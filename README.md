# Fast Food App - React with Firebase Authentication

This is a simple **Fast Food** web application built using **React**, **Vite**, and **Firebase Authentication**. The app allows users to register, log in, and access the main website content only if authenticated.

## Features:
- User Registration
- User Login
- Protected Routes
- Responsive Design
- Firebase Authentication Integration


## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AdamRharafi0027/food-firebase.git
   cd fast-food-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   This project uses **Vite** for bundling and **React** for the front end. To install all dependencies, run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Firebase:**

   - Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com/.
   - Add your Firebase config to the `.env.local` file (this file should not be pushed to GitHub). See the example below for `.env.local`:

     ```env
     VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY
     VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
     VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
     VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
     VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
     VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID
     VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID
     ```

4. **Run the app locally:**

   After setting up Firebase and installing dependencies, you can run the app locally by executing:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Getting Started

1. **Authentication:**  
   Users can register or log in using their email and password. The app uses Firebase Authentication for secure user login and sign-up processes.

2. **Protected Routes:**  
   Certain pages are protected, meaning they can only be accessed if the user is logged in. If the user is not authenticated, they will be redirected to the login page.

3. **Profile Page:**  
   After logging in, users can access their profile page. You can customize it further to allow users to edit their details.

## Usage

1. **Login Page:**  
   After registering an account, you can log in using your email and password.

2. **Signup Page:**  
   If you don't have an account, you can sign up and create a new one.

3. **Profile Page:**  
   Once you're logged in, you will be redirected to your profile page.

## Built With

- **React** - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **Vite** - Fast and modern build tool for web development
- **Firebase** - Backend service for authentication and database
- **Bootstrap** - Front-end framework for responsive design
